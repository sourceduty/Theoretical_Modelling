Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem

Theorem:
In a right-angled triangle with sides a, b, and hypotenuse c,
c^2 = a^2 + b^2

Proof:
To prove the Pythagorean theorem, we'll use a geometric approach with two squares.

1. Construct two squares:
   - Construct a large square with side length a + b.
   - Inside this large square, construct four right-angled triangles, each with sides a, b, and hypotenuse c, arranged so that their hypotenuses form a smaller, central square.

2. Calculate the area of the large square in two ways:
   
   a. As the whole square:
      Area of the large square = (a + b)^2
   
   b. As the sum of the four triangles and the central square:
      - The area of one triangle is (1/2)ab.
      - Therefore, the area of the four triangles is 4 * (1/2)ab = 2ab.
      - Let the side length of the central square be c. Thus, its area is c^2.
      - So, the total area of the large square can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the central square:
        Area of the large square = 2ab + c^2

3. Equate the two expressions for the area:
   (a + b)^2 = 2ab + c^2

4. Expand and simplify:
   a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Therefore, we have proven that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, i.e.,
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
