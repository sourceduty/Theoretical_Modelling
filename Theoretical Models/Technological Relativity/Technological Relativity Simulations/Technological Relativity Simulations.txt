This simulation program models the principles of "Technological Relativity," providing a computational framework to explore how technology evolves and impacts societal and economic systems. It integrates key concepts like technological gravity, time dilation, breakthroughs, and length contraction into a dynamic system. By simulating the flow of resources, the acceleration of technological progress, and the chain of innovations, the program helps visualize the complex interplay of factors driving exponential growth in technology.

The resource simulation incorporates the concept of technological gravity, where resource allocation is modeled as being influenced by innovation hubs, such as Silicon Valley. A saturation mechanism is included to reflect diminishing returns, ensuring that resources do not grow indefinitely but instead stabilize as they approach a theoretical limit. This dynamic mirrors real-world constraints like talent scarcity, financial bottlenecks, and infrastructure limitations that eventually slow the growth of innovation clusters.

In the technological progress module, time dilation effects are simulated with growth rates representing different hubs or sectors. Plateau dynamics have been added to reflect the periods of slowed advancement observed in real-world cases, such as the slowing pace of Moore's Law in computing. Additionally, the concept of length contraction compresses perceived progress timelines, highlighting how advancements appear faster from advanced reference frames compared to less developed contexts.

Finally, the breakthrough simulation incorporates convergence effects, where previous innovations increase the probability of new discoveries. This mechanism reflects the real-world phenomenon where technological synergies lead to paradigm-shifting breakthroughs, such as the convergence of artificial intelligence and biotechnology. Together, these modules provide a comprehensive and flexible tool for studying technological evolution. Future work could refine the model further using historical data for calibration and validation, ensuring its alignment with observed patterns in global technological development.
