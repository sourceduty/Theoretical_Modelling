Theoretical Model Creation Tool

This tool is an advanced, terminal-based Python program designed to help users build and manage detailed scientific models. It allows for the creation of complex models involving a wide array of scientific concepts such as forces, systems, laws, and variables. The program supports the specification of attributes like constants, units, and error margins for each concept, providing a structured and precise way to define scientific principles. It also introduces dynamic states, where users can track how concepts evolve over time or under specific conditions, such as changes in temperature or pressure. The model builder allows users to define relationships between concepts (e.g., "affects," "depends on") and customize the way different elements of the model interact with each other, providing a rich, flexible tool for scientific simulation and theory exploration.

This enhanced program goes beyond basic process modeling by offering features such as user-defined states and conditions, allowing users to incorporate more complex scenarios. It also includes advanced validation mechanisms that ensure the modelâ€™s consistency and scientific accuracy. By facilitating the integration of metadata and dynamic transitions, the program helps users create highly detailed theoretical models that reflect real-world phenomena. Whether it's for research, simulations, or educational purposes, the Theoretical Science Model Builder provides an intuitive, yet powerful platform for building and saving scientific models with an emphasis on clarity and precision.

Key Features:

1. Four architecture levels: Super, High, Medium, and Low.
2. Customizable step types, descriptions, priorities, and theoretical parameters.
3. Define theoretical concepts with attributes and dynamic states.
4. Model the evolution of scientific processes with dynamic states.
5. Validate models for theoretical consistency and scientific validity.
6. Specify units, constants, error margins, and more.

Example: Chemical Reaction Model

Concept: Chemical A
Type: Reactant
Description: A reactant involved in the reaction, initiating the process.
Units: Moles (mol)
Constants: None
Attributes: Initial concentration = 1.0 M

Concept: Chemical B
Type: Reactant
Description: A second reactant in the reaction.
Units: Moles (mol)
Constants: None
Attributes: Initial concentration = 1.0 M

Concept: Reaction Rate
Type: Law
Description: Rate of reaction between A and B, following the rate law.
Units: Moles per second (mol/s)
Constants: Rate constant = 0.5 L/mol/s
Attributes: r = k[A][B]

Concept: Product C
Type: Product
Description: The resulting product of the reaction.
Units: Moles (mol)
Constants: None
Attributes: Final concentration = 0.8 M

Dynamic States:
- Reaction Rate = 0.5 M/s (Time-dependent: yes)
- Product C = 0.8 M (Time-dependent: no)

Relationships:
- Chemical A affects Reaction Rate
- Chemical B affects Reaction Rate
- Reaction Rate leads to Product C

Example: Population Growth Model

Population Growth Model

Concept: Population Size
Type: Variable
Description: The number of individuals in the population.
Units: Number of individuals (individuals)
Constants: Carrying capacity = 1000 individuals
Attributes: Initial population = 50 individuals

Concept: Growth Rate
Type: Parameter
Description: The rate at which the population grows over time.
Units: Growth rate per time unit (per day)
Constants: None
Attributes: Rate = 0.1 individuals/day

Concept: Resources
Type: Condition
Description: The amount of resources available to sustain the population.
Units: Resources per unit (unit)
Constants: Total resources = 1000 units
Attributes: Resource usage = 0.1 units per individual per day

Concept: Carrying Capacity
Type: Limit
Description: The maximum sustainable population size given available resources.
Units: Number of individuals (individuals)
Constants: None
Attributes: Carrying capacity = 1000 individuals

Dynamic States:
- Population Size = 50 individuals (Time-dependent: yes)
- Growth Rate = 0.1 individuals/day (Time-dependent: yes)

Relationships:
- Population Size depends on Growth Rate
- Resources limits Population Size
- Carrying Capacity constrains Population Growth
